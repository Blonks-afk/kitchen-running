# Kitchen Runner
Kitchen runner is a helpful plugin to have during gamemodes with auto-agility training gear, like the Sage's greaves. The plugin will essentially allow you to customize when and if players in the lumbridge kitchen area will be hidden or not.

By default, the plugin will show you the correct tile to stand on when starting, only if you are not currently on them. It also opts to hide everyone except the player you specified as the conductor, until you are following them on the correct cycle (though these are customizable).

It also contains some neat features that will allow you to customize when and where you get runelite notifications. As of now, the two available options to configure are an alert for when you stop following the conductor, and an alert if the conductor sends a message that starts with "ALERT:". The conductor alert is by default disabled, but it can be useful if you want to recieve notice of conductor information, such as if they are logging off.

You should now be able to gain optimal experience rates with the greaves!
